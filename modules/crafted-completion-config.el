;; Setup completion packages. Completion in this sense is more like
;; narrowing, allowing the user to find matches based on minimal
;; inputs and "complete" the commands, variables, etc from the
;; narrowed list of possible choices.

;;; Code:

;;; Vertico
(when (require 'vertico nil :noerror)
  (require 'vertico-directory)
  ;; Cycle back to top/bottom result when the edge is reached
  (customize-set-variable 'vertico-cycle t)

  ;; Start Vertico
  (vertico-mode 1)

  ;; Turn off the built-in fido-vertical-mode and icomplete-vertical-mode, if
  ;; they have been turned on by crafted-defaults-config, because they interfere
  ;; with this module.
  (with-eval-after-load 'crafted-defaults-config
    (fido-mode -1)
    (fido-vertical-mode -1)
    (icomplete-mode -1)
    (icomplete-vertical-mode -1)))


;;; Marginalia
(when (require 'marginalia nil :noerror)
  ;; Configure Marginalia
  (customize-set-variable 'marginalia-annotators
                          '(marginalia-annotators-heavy
                            marginalia-annotators-light
                            nil))
  (marginalia-mode 1))


;;; Consult
;; Since Consult doesn't need to be required, we assume the user wants these
;; setting if it is installed (regardless of the installation method).
(when (locate-library "consult")
  ;; Set some consult bindings
  (keymap-global-set "C-s" 'consult-line)
  (keymap-set minibuffer-local-map "C-r" 'consult-history)
